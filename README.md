Molten Spherical chloride salt Fast Reactor repository.
Ondrej Chvala <ochvala@utk.edu>


Uses the Salt class from https://github.com/ondrejch/lattice-LEU-MSR/blob/master/scripts/salts.py

The directory scripts/ contains scripts to build and analyze a generic MSFR. Now with cyllindrical geometry as well. 

The direcotry small_core/ contains scripts in support of analysis of the most compact spherical core feasible with NaCl-UCl3 (eutectic 66-33mol%) fuel salt with 19.75% LEU.

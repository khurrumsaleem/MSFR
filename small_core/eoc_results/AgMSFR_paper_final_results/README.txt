This directory shows final results of the analysis of silver wire depletion in a molten chloride-salt fast-spectrum reactor.  These results are summarized in Table res.dat as plain ASCII, and res.tex as a Latex source.

The first column shows the effective reflector thickness, then the resistivity of metals (Ag, Pt, Cd mixture) alone, then the total resistivity including all other materials. The next two columns show the resistivities as ratios relative to a pure silver material. The last column shows the percent increase in the relative resistivity to the resistivity of a pure silver metal. This last column's data are plotted in Figure res.png.
